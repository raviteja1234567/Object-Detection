# Deep Learning-Based Object Detection
The project focuses on using deep learning techniques to detect aeroplanes in images using OpenCV and TensorFlow. The dataset was annotated using Makesense.ai, and the models used were pre-trained VGG16 and MobileNetV2 with additional layers, evaluated using Intersection over Union, LabelBinarizer, and finally, the best model was used to detect multiple objects in new data.
